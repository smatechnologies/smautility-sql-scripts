SMAUtility Database Scripts
===========

The SMAUtility Schedule is a Schedule which is normally put in place when OpCon is initially installed and configured. The purpose of the Schedule is to automate basic maintenance items such as database backups. Many OpCon users have altered the SMAUtility Schedule over the years by either adding their own Jobs, or slightly modifing the Jobs SMA provided.

During the release of OpCon 20 the SMAUtility Schedule's database Jobs were modified to use Embedded Scripts instead of scripts which reside on the OpCon server. This made the login credentials more secure and provided a better user experience for new users. All new OpCon environments use the newer SMAUtility Schedule, but existing SMAUtility Schedules were not modified during the upgrade.

This repository provides two things:
1. **The old SMAUtility database scripts.** The older scripts will no longer be distributed with OpCon as of OpCon 21. If you prefer the older scrips to the embedded scripts you can pull the old scripts from this repository. 
2. **The new SMAUtility database scripts.** The OpCon database upgrade scripts do not modify existing SMAUtility Schedules. The new scripts as well as brief documentation on how to set them up can be found within this repository.
  

## Old SMA Utility Database Scripts
The **SMAUtility_PreOpCon20Scripts** folder contains all of the SMAUtility database scripts which were used in releases prior to OpCon 20. These scripts will no longer be distributed as of OpCon 21 but can be downloaded from this repository. If you decide to continue to use the older scripts, please move them to a new location (away from the rest of OpCon's database scripts).

## New SMA Utility Database Scripts
The **SMAUtility_OpCon20** folder contains the scripts which are used by the new SMAUtilty Schedule. The documentation below provides a command line and a screen shot of each of the Jobs.

**Note:** The Script Type and Script Runner must be created before updating your Jobs to use Embedded Scripts.

### Create the Script Type
The SQL Script Type was not created automatically unless the new SMAUtiltiy Schedule was loaded. You will need to create a script type which looks similar to the image below. 

![SQL Script Type](/img/ScriptType.PNG)

### Create the Script Runner
The SQL Script Runner was not created automatically unless the new SMAUtiltiy Schedule was loaded.
 
**Script Runner if running OpCon on Windows:**
![SQL Script Runner Windows](/img/ScriptRunnerWindows.PNG)

```
sqlcmd -i $FILE $ARGUMENTS
```

**Script Runner if running OpCon on Docker (Linux):**
![SQL Script Runner Linux](/img/ScriptRunnerLinux.PNG)

```
/opt/mssql-tools/bin/sqlcmd -i $FILE $ARGUMENTS
```

### Global Properties
A few Global Properties are referenced by the new Jobs. These need to be created for the Jobs to work properly.
1. DB_SERVER_NAME
    * <ins>Example</ins>: SQL-OpCon
2. DatabaseName
    * <ins>Example</ins>: OPCONXPS
3. SQLMaintUser
    * <ins>Example</ins>: sa
4. SQLMaintPassword 
    * <ins>Note</ins>: We recommend encrypting this Global Property)
5. PathToFullBackupFile
    * <ins>Example</ins>: C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL.1\MSSQL\Backup\SMADB_Backup.bak
6. PathToTranLogBackupFile
    * <ins>Example</ins>: C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL.1\MSSQL\Backup\SMATLog_Backup.bak
